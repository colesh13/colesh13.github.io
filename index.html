                <h2>Welcome to the website for my GrC 400 project, Creation of License Plates!</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been interested in cars and license plates for about two years. I collect license plates from antique stores, license plate Facebook groups, and roadkill (license plates found on the side of the road). I also run an Instagram,  <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/ilovelicenseplates/?hl=en">@ilovelicenseplates</a> dedicated to vanity license plates in San Luis Obispo, CA.  
                </p>
                
          
                <p>
                    When trying to think of a project, I wanted to do something that combined a passion of mine and graphic communication. After thinking for over three months about a topic, I finally thought to research the history of how U.S. license plates are created and the manufacturing process. License plates are not only utilitarian, but are mini pieces of art and are a prime example of graphic communication in the real world.

                <p>The biggest challenge for this project was compiling license plate information. Since license plates are under the jurisdiction of state governments, each state has a slightly different history when it comes to its license plates. I tried to compile information to show the general trend of how the creation and manufacturing of license plates evolved throughout the years.</p>
