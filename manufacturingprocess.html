                <h1>Traditional manufacturing with embossing</h1>
                
                <p>The golden age of license plates involves embossing. These plates are durable, weather-resistant, and have an industrial charm due to their embossing.</p>
                
                <h2>Old Method</h2>
                <p>Embossed license plates can be made two different ways. The first way involved metal blanks being inserted into a press. The edges of the blanks are rounded with a rounded rectangle die. The blanks are then embossed with alphanumeric characters.</p>
                
                <p>Next, the plate is painted with its main color. The embossed characters, which appear to be popping off the plate, are painted with a contrasting color. This is done via an automated roller that is set to a specific height so only the raised parts of the plate are painted. </p>
                
                <p>Lastly, the reflective coating is added. This coating is a paint-like substance made from extremely fine glass beads that refract and bounce the light. This coating is not uniform due to the raised areas of the plate. Thus plates with this coating are considered only partially reflective.</p>
                
                <h2>New Method</h2>
                
                <p>First, a preprinted sheet is applied to an unstamped metal black. The preprinted sheet is already the background color of the plate and contains any other multicolor decorations. The reflective coating is also part of this sheeting. The sheet-covered blank is now stamped to create the embossed characters.</p>
                
                <p>Next, the embossed characters are covered with ink. Ink is used to allow the reflective material to remain reflective and not be dulled down by paint. Since ink is less durable than paint and license plates must be durable, the plates are covered in a clear, protective coating. These plates are now considered fully reflective but are also more expensive to produce.</p>

                <h1>Digital License Plate Manufacturing</h1>
                <p>As technology has improved and evolved, so has license plate manufacturing technology. License plates can now be produced with a completely digital workflow which saves money, but loses its industrial charm. Digital allows for more complicated graphics to be incorporated onto plates as well.</p>
                
               
                
                <h2>Digital Workflow</h2>

                <p>A thermal transfer ribbon process prints the license plate alphanumeric characters and graphics onto a large roll of white reflective vinyl sheeting. A four color press is used to print to achieve a large gamut of colors. This press uses heat to print the desired images onto the vinyl. The press will also print a security seal and virtual security thread onto the vinyl. One roll of vinyl can produce about 1,100 license plates. A clear laminate is then applied to the vinyl to protect the printed colors and characters from the elements. Finally, the vinyl is rolled up to prepare for the next process.</p>
                
                <p>The roll of printed vinyl now heads to the blanking line. The vinyl, which has a pressure sensitive backing, is applied to an uncut, aluminum sheet. A machine simultaneously peels away the backing of the vinyl and presses it onto the large roll of aluminum substrate sheeting. </p>
                
                <p>Once the vinyl is attached to the aluminum, it is time for cutting. The uncut plates go to a blanking line that cuts the metal in three ways. First, the plates are cut into their standard 6 inch by 12 inch size. Then, the edges are rounded. Lastly, mounting holes are cut so the plates can be mounted to vehicles.</p>
                
                <p>The digital workflow can produce up to 90,000 license plates per day. This is a drastic improvement in efficency since only 50,000 embossed plates can be made daily. It is obvious digital or "flat" plates are much faster to produce than embossed plates. Since digital plates do not use liquid ink, they do not have a drying period, unlike embossed plates, and are ready for shipment as soon as they come off the press. It only takes about one minute to produce one digital plate.</p>
                
                <p>Flat license plates have created some controversy in the license plate collecting community. Many collectors do not view flat license plates as worth collecting. Being able to see the characters pop off embossed plates is a unique look with a lot of charm but it appears the industry is moving towards digital license plates.</p>
