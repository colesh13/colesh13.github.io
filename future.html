           <h1>The future of license plates</h1>
            
           
            <h2>Screens are everywhere. Why not put them on license plates?</h2>

            <p>The future of license plates has arrived. The company, Reviver, has created the first electronic license plate. This device includes a e-ink screen, similar to a screen found on a Kindle e-reader. This screen makes it glare-free, unlike a normal backlit screen in direct sunlight. </p>
            
            <p>These plates can do much more than display characters. These plates can display messages such as emergency alerts or even if the car the stolen. Images can also be displayed to mimick the designs found on their metal counterparts. </p>
            
            <p>This move to electronic license plates is still not widespread, but it does show where the future of license plates is headed. This is important in the Graphic Communication field as we must keep up with these evolving trends in order to stay relevant.</p>
            
            <p>Electronic license plates are DMV approved and only available in California and Arizona currently. This technology is coming to Michigan, Texas, and Illinois soon and hopefully will be expanded to all 50 states.</p>
